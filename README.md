# Body Mass Properties
Application for calculating body MOI (Moments Of Inertia) tensor. 

Bodies are assembled from primitives that can be added or subtracted to get complex shapes. 
Relative position of primitives can be specified in relative or absolute coordinate. Orientation can be set in various orientation definition systems (Euler, DeSparr, Hamilton-Rodriguez).
